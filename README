= Drop =
Drop is a series of scripts that make dynamic malware analysis more
straightforward with kvm.

= Dependencies =
This code was written and tested on debian squeeze. It ought to
work on any Linux system assuming you use similar versions of the
dependencies.

== Drop ==
isc-dhcp-server (isc-dhcpd-4.1.1-P1)
sudo
iptables
kvm (qemu-kvm-0.12.5)
uml-utilities -- for tunctl (and tun/tap setup)
an http server (lighttpd)
tcpdump

== GZA ==
nfqueue-bindings-python (0.4)
python-scapy (2.1.0)
python-dnspython
python-ipy

== Results Generation ==
r-base-core
python-dpkt

You can install everything with the following command:
$ sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server iptables kvm uml-uilities lighttpd nfqueue-bindings-python python-scapy python-dnspython python-ipy r-base-core python-dpkt tcpdump

= Installation =
The script win/stage1.py must be executed at boot time in the virtual machine
image you wish to run with GZA. This downloads the stage2.py binary that is
stored on the host running the virtual machines. stage2.py has experiment
specific instructions for obtaining and running the binary(ies) you wish to
analyze. For most purposes, and to verify my experiments, win/stage2-dropper.py
should be sufficient.
